# Earthquake-database-with-pandas
I am using the pandas library in the project. 
Database contains data on earthquakes that were greater than 5.5 magnitude and occurred from 1965 to 2017.

I use the data cleaning functions.
I divide numerical data into categories with the cut function. 
I use the data reshaping functions, stack and melt. 
I make 4 different types of graphs.

Data file must be in same directory as ipynb file.

This project is built using:
Python (3.9.7),
Jupyter notebook (7.0.4),
Pandas (2.1.1),
Matplotlib (3.8.0).
